      <p>
        My name is Kenneth Adaga. A Nigerian by Birth. Born the Family of Mr.
        and Mrs. Adaga<br />
        At present, I reside at the northern region of the my country. Kaduna to
        be precise.<br />
        I applied to study Software Engineering, with Cloud Computing as my
        track specialty.<br />

        <br /><b>REASONS FOR ENROLLING TO STUDY AT ALTSCHOOLAFRICA:</b><br />
        Right from a teenage age of 15, I have always been profundly interested
        in computing and computers both <br/>their hardware and software. Regrettably, 
        I never had the chance to study computer science in the University.<br />
        <br />Over the years, my interest in the computing field has kept on
        growing more profound and passionate with every<br />
        new discovery I made. From experiencing the wonders of the Internet for
        the first time to communicating with an <br />
        artificial intelligence,computers have left me fascinated with just how
        much power yet mystery they hold. <br />I strongly believe in the
        philosophy that says; “do what you love in your life, and you will never
        regret”.
       <p> As for me, one of such things I love doing is the job of software
        engineering.<br />
        I am signing up to pursue this career path so I can better myself for
        the future and gain qualifications for some of the skills that I already
        possess.</p>
               
        <p>I already have intermediate knowledge and experience in this
          subject and I regret not diving deepinto it years before now.<br />
          May
          I also mention the fact that in our present day modern world, it is
          virtually impossible to escape computers as they are part of several
          things that touch our lives, making them easier and creating solutions
          for many complex and challenging problems. Computer science is at the
          forefront of breakthroughs in science, technology and at the heart of
          virtually all cutting edge inventions in fields like engineering,
          business, entertainment and education to mention just a few.</p>
          
          <p>It is 
            unargueably an interdisciplinary and dynamic subject. Computing careers
            are not only here to stay but are expanding all the time, across the
            continents. It is one of those fields where it is very hard to predict
            what will happen in the future, this is why I cannot even begin to
            imagine all the ways that you can make a contribution to it, but I am
            sure that it can make one's life and work exciting and fulfilling.
            Conversely, on subject specific level, my attraction to software
            engineering field is the many types of lucrative careers that this
            certification will open up.</p> 

            <p>At present, I can understand programming
              beyond the constraints of the syntax, and also comprehend the logic
              behind how you should implement solutions to computing problems.</p>I am
          also a person with a serious and focused attitude to my work. Prior to
          my discovery of Altschool Africa few months ago, I have been
          self-studying to enhance my knowledge of programming language. Without
          mincing words, this scholarship is very crucial to me as I come from a
          family with moderate income. <br /></p>
        
        <p>I am quite hopeful that with the financial support from this
          scholarship, I can relieve the financial burden off my family. Besides,
          this scholarship will also help me realise my aspirations to become a
          software engineer so I can utilise technology as a tool to contribute
          impactfully to my country, the continent of Africa and the globe at
          large.
          <br /></p>  
          
          <p>It will be tough for me to accomplish this noble goal without the
            help of this scholarship. I have dreamed of becoming a software
            engineer, too long to fall short of this goal in life. I am very
            resolute to achieve this target no matter how tasking or tedious it
            might be.
             <br /></p>

                <p>Thank you once more for the opportunity to express myself.
